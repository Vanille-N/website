== Projects

The projects in this list are at various stages of being
completed / stalled / abandoned, but I am at least somewhat proud of all of them.
For a more complete list, see my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Vanille-N).

- [Pytrace (Rust)](https://github.com/Vanille-N/ray_tracer), able to
  render videos and high-quality images, also available as a Python
  library
- [COCass (OCaml)](https://github.com/Vanille-N/cocass), native compiler
  for a small C without floating-point arithmetic, but with added
  exception handling
- [Forklang (C)](https://github.com/Vanille-N/forklang), a small
  non-deterministic language to validate parallelized protocols
- [Billig (Rust)](https://github.com/Vanille-N/billig) is a DSL to record
  expenses, ergonomic enough for my current daily usage but still a work
  in progress
- [Chandeliers (Rust)](https://github.com/Vanille-N/chandeliers) is a proc
  macro library that implements the
  [Lustre language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(programming_language))
  inside Rust.
- [Minihell (OCaml)](https://gitlab.com/Vanille-N/mpri-2.4-project-2023-2024) is a
  type inference engine for a toy language implemented for the
  [MPRI class 2.4 (Functionnal Programming)](https://gitlab.inria.fr/fpottier/mpri-2.4-public/blob/master/README.md).
  The language is ML-style without polymorphism and supports inductive
  algebraic datatypes.
